# Optimized Trade Execution with Deep Q Network

Here are my implementation of Deep Q Network in Pytorch, inspired by this [paper](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~mkearns/papers/rlexec.pdf), in which I modified from the Q-Learning idea in the paper into a Deep Q Network, using an architecture similar to the [Atari playing paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1312.5602). The idea is tested against TWAP and VWAP for transaction cost optimization.
